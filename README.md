# Chrome-to-Certify

This automation saves the active tab in Google Chrome as a PDF and then emails it to Certify. It is designed to work on macOS and not on iOS.

## Requirements
- Runs on macOS
- You must have your email address connected to Apple’s Mail app

Files are temporarily stored in the “Automation/Send to Certify” folder in the User Folder. If that folder does not exist, this shortcut will create it.
